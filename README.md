# Do 'feminised' government workplaces pay less?

I've examined this question several times but it keeps popping up. So I'm publishing this analysis — and the relevant data — for when it's next asked.

The Australian Public Service decentralised pay bargaining in the 1990s. In the years since, unions and some politicians have said that agencies with a higher proportion of female staff pay less than others. The Community and Public Sector Union repeated this argument in the lead-up to this year's APS enterprise agreement negotiations.

The new government [says it is trying to reduce pay gaps between APS agencies](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-06-02/which-public-servants-will-receive-a-pay-boost/102420798). To aid this, the Australian Public Service Commission has collated and shared the salary ranges of 102 APS agencies. I've combined these data [with other APSC employment data](https://www.apsc.gov.au/employment-data/aps-employment-data-31-december-2022) to examine the associations between a workforce's gender split and the salaries they receive.

In short, the answer is no: Australian Public Service 

Australian Public Service staff are negotiating their next enterprise agreements. Their union, the Community and Public Sector Union, said in a submission that government agencies with more female staff tend to pay less than other agencies. This is a question I've examined previously (because, if true, it would have been a big news story!). I believe it was once true, but it hasn't been the case for a while. I correlated minimum #salaries in almost all APS agencies with the percentage of staff at each level who are women. These graphs show results for APS5 through to EL2. The R² value is below 0.2 for all of them — i.e. there is no meaningful correlation. (The circle sizes reflect the number of staff at that level in each agency.) This is good news for women! The APS has done a lot of work this century removing barriers for female staff.
